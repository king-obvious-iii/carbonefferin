carbonefferin
=============
The goal of carbonefferin is to pull as many useful commits as possible into one flashable ROM based on Carbon, which is based on Cyanogenmod.  Basically, this project will be a mutt, but the good thing about mutts is that they suffer less chance of mental retardation because of stagnation in the breed over time; and thus, a smarter breed with more focus on what the end user will find appealing.
